Database	Introduction	Details	Software and parameters
Nr	NCBI non-redundant protein sequences，NCBI official protein sequence database	Including the protein coding sequence of GenBank gene, PDB (Protein Data Bank) protein database, SwissProt protein sequence and protein sequence from databases such as PIR (Protein Information esource) and PRF (Protein Research Foundation). Its characteristic is that the content is relatively comprehensive, and at the same time, the annotation results will contain species information, which can be used for species classification.	diamond v0.8.36；e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
Nt	NCBI nucleotide sequences，NCBI official nucleic acid sequence database	Nucleic acid sequences from GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ (but not EST, STS, GSS, WGS, TSA, PAT, HTG sequences) are included.	ncbi-blast-2.7.1+; e-value = 1e-5
Pfam	Protein family, the most comprehensive classification system for protein domain annotation	Proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of each specific structural domain has a certain degree of conservation. PFAM divides protein domains into different protein families, and establishes the HMM statistical model of the amino acid sequence of each family through protein sequence alignment. The PFAM family is divided into two categories according to the reliability of the annotation results: the Pfam-A family with high reliability of manual annotation and the Pfam-B family automatically generated by the program. Through the HMMER3 program, you can search the HMM model of the protein domain that has been built, so as to annotate the gene family. See http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ for details.

KOG/COG	COG: Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins; KOG: euKaryotic Ortholog Groups	Both KOG and COG are NCBI-based gene ortholog relationships, where COG is for prokaryotes and KOG is for eukaryotes. COG/KOG combines evolutionary relationships to divide homologous genes from different species into different Ortholog clusters. Currently, COG has 4873 categories and KOG has 4852 categories. Genes from the same ortholog have the same function, allowing direct inheritance of functional annotations to other members of the same COG/KOG cluster. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/ for details .	diamond v0.8.36; e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
Swiss-Prot	A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database	A collection of protein sequences organized and researched by experienced biologists. See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/ for details.	diamond v0.8.36; e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
KEGG	Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes	A database that systematically analyzes the metabolic pathways of gene products and compounds in cells and the functions of these gene products. It integrates genome, chemical molecule and biochemical system data, including metabolic pathway (KEGG PATHWAY), drug (KEGG DRUG), disease (KEGG DISEASE), functional model (KEGG MODULE), gene sequence (KEGG GENES) and genome (KEGG GENOME) and so on. The KO (KEGG ORTHOLOG) system links the various KEGG annotation systems together. KEGG has established a complete KO annotation system, which can complete the functional annotation of the genome or transcriptome of newly sequenced species. See http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ for details.	diamond v0.8.36; e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
go	Gene Ontology, an internationally standardized classification system for gene function description	GO is divided into three categories of ontology: biological process (Biological Process), molecular function (Molecular Function) and cellular component (Cellular Component), which are used to describe the biological process, molecular function and the cellular environment. The basic unit of GO is term, and each term has a unique identifier (consisting of "GO:" plus 7 numbers, such as GO:0072669); the terms of each type of ontology form a directed acyclic topology through their connections (is_a, part_of, regulate). See http://www.geneontology.org/.	Self-written script for protein annotation results based on Pfam database
