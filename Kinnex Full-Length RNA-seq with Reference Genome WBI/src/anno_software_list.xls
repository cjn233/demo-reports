Database	Introduction	Details	Software.and.parameters
Nr	NCBI non-redundant protein sequences	Including the protein coding sequence of GenBank gene, PDB (Protein Data  Bank) protein database, SwissProt protein sequence and protein sequence  from databases such as PIR (Protein information Resource) and PRF  (Protein Research Foundation). It is characterized by its relatively comprehensive content and includes annotation results with species information, which can be utilized for species classification.	diamond v0.8.36ï¼›e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
Nt	NCBI nucleotide sequences	Nucleic acid sequences from GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ (but not EST, STS, GSS, WGS, TSA, PAT, HTG sequences) are included.	ncbi-blast-2.7.1+; e-value = 1e-5
Pfam	Protein family	Proteins are composed of structural domains, and the protein sequence of  each specific structural domain has a certain degree of conservation.  Pfam divides protein domains into different protein families, and  establishes the HMM statistical model of the amino acid sequence of each  family through protein sequence alignment. The Pfam family is divided  into two categories according to the reliability of the annotation  results: the Pfam-A family with high reliability of manual annotation  and the Pfam-B family automatically generated by the program. Through  the HMMER3 program, you can search the HMM model of the protein domain  that has been built, so as to annotate the gene family. Seehttp://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/for details.

KOG/COG	COG: Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins; KOG: Eukaryotic orthologous
 Groups	Both KOG and COG are NCBI-based gene ortholog relationships, where COG  is for prokaryotes and KOG is for eukaryotes. COG/KOG combines  evolutionary relationships to divide homologous genes from different  species into different Ortholog clusters. Currently, COG has 4873  categories and KOG has 4852 categories. Genes from the same ortholog  have the same function, allowing direct inheritance of functional  annotations to other members of the same COG/KOG cluster. Seehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/for details .	diamond v0.8.36; e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
Swiss-Prot	A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database	A collection of protein sequences organized and researched by experienced biologists. Seehttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/for details.	diamond v0.8.36; e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
KEGG	Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes	A database that systematically analyzes the metabolic pathways of gene  products and compounds in cells and the functions of these gene  products. It integrates genome, chemical molecule and biochemical system  data, including metabolic pathway (KEGG PATHWAY), drug (KEGG DRUG),  disease (KEGG DISEASE), functional model (KEGG MODULE), gene sequence  (KEGG GENES) and genome (KEGG GENOME) and so on. The KO (KEGG ORTHOLOG)  system links the various KEGG annotation systems together. KEGG has  established a complete KO annotation system, which can complete the  functional annotation of the genome or transcriptome of newly sequenced  species. Seehttp://www.genome.jp/kegg/for details.	diamond v0.8.36; e-value = 1e-5, --more-sensitive
GO	Gene Ontology	GO is divided into three categories of ontology: biological process  (Biological Process), molecular function (Molecular Function) and  cellular component (Cellular Component), which are used to describe the  biological process, molecular function and the cellular environment. The  basic unit of GO is term, and each term has a unique identifier  (consisting of GO: plus 7 numbers, such asGO:0072669); the terms of each type of ontology form a directed acyclic topology through their connections (is_a, part_of, regulate).
