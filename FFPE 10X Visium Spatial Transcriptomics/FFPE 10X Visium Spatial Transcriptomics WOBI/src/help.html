				<div class="text_content">
				<p class="second_p" style="text-indent:2em"> RNA-seq is a transcriptome analysis method based on next-generation sequencing: Acquiring all the transcription related RNA from the bio-sample, then synthesizing the c-DNA by reverse transcription and applying c-DNA to high-throughput sequencing. The specific transcripts can be obtained after assembling the reads from sequencing. Basing on sequencing analysis, we can develop biological understanding of sample state from gene expression. In addition, comparing gene expression among different samples helps us identify the target genes of expression regulation, for example, the up-regulated gene and the down-regulated gene. Furthermore, the GO/KEGG functional enrichment analysis of target genes may discover gene function.</p>
